# YouTube Downloader

This application downloads specified YouTube videos, adds metadata to the files (Artist name, album name, etc.) and adds the song appropriately to your iTunes library in the correct location. It also searches google to find the appropriate album cover for the song and adds it to the file as well. This makes it a lot easier to download music from YouTube, since it requires no manual work.
